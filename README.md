# Answer King

Dotnet implementation of the Answer King Api

## The following libraries/technologies were used:

- [.NET Core (.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform)](https://dot.net)
- [LiteDb (An open source MongoDB-like database with zero configuration)](https://www.litedb.org/)
- [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore (Swagger / OpenAPI - Automatically generates Api Documentation)](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore)
- [FluentValidation.AspNetCore (A popular .NET library for building strongly-typed validation rules)](https://fluentvalidation.net/)

## Running the solution

Ensure you have the latest [.NET 6 SDK (v6.0.401)](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/) installed.

Clone the project:

`$ git clone git@gitlab.com:AnswerAcademy/Answer.King.git`

CD into the newly cloned repository:

`$ cd Answer.King`

Now run the project: smile

`$ dotnet run --project src/Answer.King.Api/Answer.King.Api.csproj`

Now open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:5001` and you should be greeted by the swagger interface describing the api

## Unit Testing

The project is accompanied by unit tests. The project uses `xUnit` for testing.

## Code Coverage For Unit Tests

To generate a report for code coverage:

Ensure you have 'Run Coverlet Report' extension added - Extensions menu and select Manage Extensions. Then, search Run Coverlet Report.

VS Code - Click on the Tools tab and 'Run Code Coverage'

Or

Rider - Click on Tests tab and 'Cover All Tests from Solution'

Or

In the terminal run:

- dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

Then - reportgenerator -reports:"Path\To\TestProject\TestResults\{guid}\coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coveragereport" -reporttypes:Html

For example - reportgenerator -reports:"C:\Users\HarryStead\Documents\AnswerKing-CS\tests\Answer.King.Api.UnitTests\TestResults\{guid}\coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coveragereport" -reporttypes:Html
